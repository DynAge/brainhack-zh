# First Brainhack Zurich <br/> Open tools for reproducible neuroscience <br/> March 2 & 3, 2017

We are happy to announce the first Brainhack in Zurich.
It will be held on March 2 & 3 2017 as part of
[Brainhack Global](http://events.brainhack.org/global2017/).

Brainhack workshops offer an open platform for
brain-imaging-scientists of all levels of experience to meet and
discuss new ideas. In the beginning of March, over 40 sites across
the globe will simultaneously hold Brainhack events.

The Zurich Brainhack will focus on introductory hands-on tutorials
on tools for (neuroimaging) data analysis to promote reproducible
science. Furthermore, the event aims to connect the Swiss
neuroscience community by providing a space for open discussion.
